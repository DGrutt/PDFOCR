["the singularity and human destiny by patrick tucker, ﬂssistant editor, the futubist  in 1949, several decades before the birth of the pc, computer scientist john von neumann an- nounced, ”it would appear we have reached the limits of what is possible to achieve with com- puter technology. ” he quickly and prudently added, ”one should be careful with such state- ments; they tend to sound pretty silly in five years.”  more than half a century later, it is neumann’s caveat rather than his prediction that is borne out daily. our computer intelligence is growing at an ever-quickening pace, surpassed only by our de— pendence on computer technology. for many of us, computers and computer—based devices have become not so much tools as appendages, third arms that are integral to our lives, cumbersome on occasion, and increasingly willful. this begs the obvious question: if computer power advances be- yond our control, how will that change us?  in his most recent book, the singularity is near, author and inventor ray kurzweil provides us with a clue. imagine that with the help of a small device you could create a perfect replica of any ob— ject—gianlorenzo bernini's david, the hub cap from a '78 dodge dart—seemingly from vapor. imagine that through virtual-reality software you won’t be shackled to a particular position in time, and could exist in several locations at once—work, home, a seaside bungalow in bora bora—and each setting in which you chose to locate yourself looked, sounded, and felt perfectly real. imagine that you could live indefinitely in a world in which all poverty, pollution, and scarcity has been van- quished. imagine that there existed no limitation to what you could do or be, except for those limita— tions that you imposed yourself.  this scenario may sound like a cross between  thomas moore’s utopia and christopher marlow’s doctor faustus, but according to ray kurzweil it is our real and fast—approaching future. it will come about as the result of an ex- plosion in our technological abilities. we will in— corporate more computer-based processes into our biological functioning until we transcend our crude, earthly bodies entirely and become machine-based, virtually immortal. this coming period of rapid technological progress and its miraculous effects will occur within the next 50 years and is what kurzweil refers to as the singularity.  the concept is both startling and optimistic, but it immediately provokes certain philosophi— cal concerns. if nanotechnology allows us to create any object, will any object ever again be valuable? what role will responsibility, temper— ance, and discipline play in a world where any urge can be gratified at almost the same moment it is felt? what will pass for morality when there is no mortal consequence to any action?  these questions cannot and should not be an- swered all at once—either by ray kurzweil, his devotees, or his critics. rather, what is im— portant is that they be asked, repeatedly and earnestly, and by as many people as possible.  to further the debate of these key issues, the futurist presents kurzweil’s insights and ideas along with invited commentaries from nanotechnology expert j. storrs hall, accelera- tion studies scholar john smart, and soci- ologists damien broderick and richard eckersely. together, they examine this issue of the singularity to determine how near it is exactly, and explore what it might mean for humanity  order the march—apri12006 issue of the futurist from https: / /www.wfs.org/futuristorderhtm.", '@2006 world future

inventor ray itulzweil sees a radical evolution of the human species in the next 40 years.  we stand on the threshold of the most profound and transformative event in the history of humanity, the ”singularity.”  what is the singularity? from my perspective, the singularity is a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so fast and far-reach- ing that human existence on this planet will be irreversibly altered. we will combine our brain power—the knowledge, skills, and personality quirks that make us human—with our computer power in order to think, reason, communicate, and create in ways we can scarcely even contemplate today.  this merger of man and machine, coupled with the sudden explosion in machine intelligence and rapid innovation in gene research and nanotechnology, will result in a world where there is no distinction between the biological and the mechanical, or between physi- cal and virtual reality. these technological revolutions will allow us to transcend our frail bodies with all their limitations. illness, as we know it, will be eradi- cated. through the use of nanotechnology, we will be able to manufacture almost any physical product upon demand, world hunger and poverty will be solved, and pollution will vanish. human existence will undergo a quantum leap in evolution. we will be  the futurist march—april 2006 39', 'able to live as long as we choose. the coming into being of such a world is, in essence, the singularity.  how is it possible that we could be so close to this enormous change and not see it? the answer is the quickening nature of technological innovation. in thinking about the future, few people take into consid- eration the fact that human scientific progress is exponential: it expands by repeatedly multiplying by a con- stant (10 times 10 times 10, and so on) rather than linear (10 plus 10 plus 10, and so on). i emphasize the exponential-versus-linear perspec- tive because it’s the most important failure that prognosticators make in considering future trends.  our forebears expected what lay ahead of them to resemble what they had already experienced, with few exceptions. because they lived dur- ing a time when the rate of techno- logical innovation was so slow as to be unnoticeable, their expectations of an unchanged future were continu- ally fulfilled. today, we have wit- nessed the acceleration of the curve. therefore, we anticipate continuous technological progress and the social repercussions that follow. we see the future as being different from the present. but the future will be far more surprising than most people realize, because few observers have truly internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change is itself accelerating.  exponential growth starts out slowly and virtually unnoticeably, but beyond the knee of the curve it turns explosive and profoundly transformative. my models show that we are doubling the paradigm- shift rate for technology innovation every decade. in other words, the twentieth century was gradually speeding up to today’s rate of progress; its achievements, therefore, were equivalent to about 20 years of progress at the rate of 2000. we’ll make another ”20 years” of progress in just 14 years (by 2014), and then do the same again in only seven years. to express this another way, we won’t experience 100 years of technological advance in the twenty- first century; we will witness on the order of 20,000 years of progress (again, when measured by today’s  40 the futurist march—apri12006  progress rate), or progress on a level of about 1,000 times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century.  how will we know the singularity ls upon us?  the first half of the twenty-first century will be characterized by three overlapping revolutions—in genetics, nanotechnology, and robot- ics. these will usher in the beginning of this period of tremendous change i refer to as the singularity. we are in the early stages of the genetics revo- lution today. by understanding the information processes underlying life, we are learning to reprogram our biology to achieve the virtual elimination of disease, dramatic ex- pansion of human potential, and radical life extension. however, hans moravec of carnegie mellon university’s robotics institute points out that, no matter how successfully we fine-tune our dna-based biol- ogy, biology will never be able to match what we will be able to engi- neer once we fully understand life’s principles of operation. in other words, we will always be ”second- class robots.”  the nanotechnology revolution will enable us to redesign and re- build—molecule by molecule—our bodies and brains and the world with which we interact, going far be- yond the limitations of biology.  but the most powerful impending revolution is the robotic revolution. by robotic, i am not referring ex- clusively—or even primarily—to humanoid-looking droids that take up physical space, but rather to arti- ficial intelligence in all its variations.                www. wfs. org  following, i have laid out the prin- cipal components underlying each of these coming technological revolu- tions. while each new wave of progress will solve the problems from earlier transformations, each will also introduce new perils. each, operating both separately and in concert, underpins the singularity.  the genetic revolution  genetic and molecular science will extend biology and correct its obvi- ous flaws (such as our vulnerability to disease). by the year 2020, the full effects of the genetic revolution will be felt across society. we are rapidly gaining the knowledge and the tools to drastically extend the usability of the ”house" each of us calls his body and brain.  nanomedicine researcher robert freitas estimates that eliminating 50% of medically preventable condi- tions would extend human life ex- pectancy to 150 years. if we were able to prevent 99% of naturally oc- curring medical problems, we’d live to be more than 1,000 years old.  we can see the beginnings of this awesome medical revolution today. the field of genetic biotechnology is fueled by a growing arsenal of tools. drug discovery was once a matter of finding substrates (chemicals) that produced some beneficial result without excessive side effects, a research method similar to early humans’ seeking out rocks and other natural implements that could be used for helpful purposes. today, we are discovering the precise biochemi- cal pathways that underlie both dis- ease and aging processes. we are  continued on page 42  photoscom  in the future, more drugs will be designed to carry out precise missions at the molecular level.', "bag lturzweil’s plan for cheating death  ﬂ cure for aging may he found in the next fiftg gears. the trick now is to live long enough to be there when it happens. here’s how llurzweil is trying to do it.  by terry grossman  i first met ray kurzweil in 1999  at a foresight institute meeting in  palo alto. i was there to get some  background information on nano-  technology for a new book i was  writing. as i stood in the lunch  line, a healthy-appearing man in  front of me was engaged in animated conversa-  tion with a not nearly so healthy-looking second  man. their topic of conversation was vitamins  and nutritional supplementation, a topic of great interest to me, a nutritionally oriented m.d.  i joined the conversation, and the healthy- looking man introduced himself as ray kurzweil. ray and i continued our dialogue via e-mail after the conference ended, and a few months later, he ﬂew from his home in boston to frontier medical institute, my longevity clinic in denver, for a comprehensive longevity medical evaluation. we performed a comprehensive bat- tery of tests designed to uncover any health risks he might still have so that together we could op- timize his already very sophisticated program for health and longevity.  from the beginning, it was obvious that ray would be a unique patient. i have many engi- neers as patients in my practice (and ray is an engineer by training), so i am not surprised when patients come to see me with a notebook of spreadsheets detailing various data ex- tracted from their daily lives: blood pressure, weight, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, amount of exercise, etc., carefully tabulated for several years. but all previous data collections i had seen, even those organized into excel and meticulously graphed, paled in comparison to ray’s. his data collection was so thorough and meticulous that he could tell me what he ate for lunch on june 23, 1989 (as well as what he ate for lunch every other day for several years before that time). and not only what he ate, but the number of grams of each serving and calories consumed, as well as the number of calories he burned that day through exercise— every day for decades!  as a result, it came as less of a surprise for me  to learn that ray was taking over 200 supple- ment pills a day. ray’s approach had been to ac- curately assess his personal health risks and then quite simply to ”reprogram his biochemistry.” ongoing testing indicates that he is doing a re- markable job, as measurement of his biological age in my clinic indicates that he is now almost two decades younger than his chronological age, and all of his health risks appear under optimal control.  ray was already working on his new book, the singularity is near, at that time, and i had just completed my first book, the baby boomers' guide to living forever. it was natural that our e-mail di- alogue moved into discussion of the prospects for truly radical life extension for people of all ages, including older boomers like ourselves. as our e-mails multiplied into the many thousands, we decided to organize the information and see if we had the makings of a new book that we would co-author. i created a preliminary table of contents, ray organized the information from our e-mails, and, another 10,000 e-mails or so later, our joint book, fantastic voyage: live long enough to live forever, was written in the midst of ray’s writing of the singularity is near.  ray felt that he was writing these books to- gether as a unit and that there was synergy between them. the singularity is near details ray’s vision of the astounding possibilities of the world of the near future as the singularity un- folds sometime within the next few decades. in fantastic voyage, we provide readers with the in- formation they need to live long enough and remain healthy enough to fully experience the wonders of life in the post-singularity world. in writing these two books, ray has painted a clear picture of the future and provided a blueprint for how to get there.     about the author  terry grossman, m.d., is the founder and medical director of frontier medical institute in denver, colorado. he is the co-author of

page 40  able to design drugs to carry out pre- cise missions at the molecular level. with recently developed gene tech- nologies, we’re on the verge of being able to control how genes express themselves. gene expression is the process by which cellular compo- nents (specifically rna and the ribo- somes) produce proteins according to a precise genetic blueprint. while every human cell contains a com- plete dna sample, and thus the full complement of the body’s genes, a specific cell, such as a skin cell or a pancreatic islet cell, gets its charac- teristics from only the fraction of genetic information relevant to that particular cell type.  gene expression is controlled by peptides (molecules made up of se- quences of up to 100 amino acids) and short rna strands. we are now beginning to learn how these processes work. many new therapies currently in development and testing are based on manipulating peptides either to turn off the expression of disease-causing genes or to turn on desirable genes that may otherwise not be expressed in a particular type of cell. a new technique called rna interference is able to destroy the messenger rna expressing a gene and thereby effectively turn that gene off.  accelerating progress in biotech- nology will enable us to reprogram our genes and metabolic processes to propel the fields of genomics (influ- encing genes), proteomics (under- standing and influencing the role of proteins), gene therapy (suppressing gene expression as well as adding new genetic information), rational drug design (formulating drugs that target precise changes in disease and aging processes), as well as the ther- apeutic cloning of rejuvenated cells, tissues, and organs.  the nanotechnology revolution  nanotechnology promises the tools to rebuild the physical world, our bodies, and our brains, molecu- lar fragment by molecular fragment and potentially atom by atom. we are shrinking the key features (work- ing parts), in

rate (over four per linear dimension per decade, or about 100 per 3-d volume.) at this rate, the key feature sizes for most electronic and many mechanical technologies will be in the nanotechnology range—generally considered to be less than 100 nanometers (one- billionth of one meter)—by the 2020s. electronics has already dipped below this threshold, al- though not yet in three-dimensional structures and not yet in structures that are capable of assembling other similar structures, an essential step before nanotechnology can reach its promised potential. meanwhile, rapid progress has been made re- cently in preparing the conceptual framework and design ideas for the coming age of nanotechnology.  nanotechnology has expanded to include any technology in which a machine’s key features are measured by fewer than 100 nanometers. just as contemporary electronics has al- ready quietly slipped into this nano realm, the area of biological and medical applications has already en- tered the era of nanoparticles, in which nanoscale objects are being developed to create more-effective tests and treatments.  in the area of testing and diagno- sis, nanoparticles are being em- ployed in experimental biological tests as tags and labels to greatly en- hance sensitivity in detecting sub- stances such as proteins. magnetic nanotags can be used to bind with antibodies that can then be read us- ing magnetic probes while still in- side the body. successful experi- ments have been conducted with gold nanoparticles that are bound to  www. wfs. org  dna segments and can rapidly test for specific dna sequences in a sample. small nanoscale beads called quantum dots can be pro- grammed with specific codes com- bining multiple colors, similar to a color bar code, that can facilitate tracking of substances through the body.  in the future, nanoscale devices will run hundreds of tests simultane- ously on tiny samples of a given sub- stance. these devices will allow ex- tensive tests to be conducted on nearly invisible samples of blood.  in the area of treatment, a particu- larly exciting application of this tech- nology is the harnessing of nanopar- ticles to deliver medication to specific sites in the body. nanopar- ticles can guide drugs into cell walls and through the blood-brain barrier. nanoscale packages can be designed to hold drugs, protect them through the gastrointestinal tract, ferry them to specific locations, and then release them in sophisticated ways that can be influenced and controlled, wire- lessly, from outside the body.  nanotherapeutics in alachua, florida, has developed a biodegrad- able polymer only several nanome- ters thick that uses this approach. meanwhile, scientists at mcgill uni- versity in montreal have demon- strated a nanopill with structures in the 25 to 45 nanometer range. the nanopill is small enough to pass through the cell wall and deliver medications directly to targeted structures inside the cell.  microchips of bedford, massa- chusetts, has developed a computer- ized device that is implanted under the skin and delivers precise mix- tures of medicines from hundreds of nanoscale wells inside the device. future versions of the device are ex- pected to be able to measure blood levels of substances such as glucose. the system could be used as an arti- ficial pancreas, releasing precise amounts of insulin based on the blood glucose response. the system would also be capable of simulating any other hormone-producing or- gan. if trials go smoothly, the system could be on the market by 2008. an- other innovative proposal is to guide nanoparticles (probably composed of gold) to a tumor site and then heat', 'them with infrared beams to destroy the cancer cells.  the revolution in nanotechnology will allow us to do a great deal more than simply treat disease. ultimately, nanotech will enable us to redesign and rebuild not only our bodies and brains, but also the world with which we interact. the full realiza- tion of nanotechnology, however, will lag behind the biotechnology revolution by about one decade. but by the mid to late 2020s, the effects of the nanotech revolution will be widespread and obvious.  nanotechnology and the human brain  the most important and radical application particularly of circa-2030 nanobots will be to expand our minds through the merger of bio- logical and nonbiological, or ”ma- chine," intelligence. in the next 25 years, we will learn how to augment our 100 trillion very slow inter- neuronal connections with high- speed virtual connections via nano- robotics. this will allow us to greatly boost our pattern-recognition abili-  photoscom     our brains today are relatively fixed in de- sign. as humanity’s artificial-intelligence (ai) capabilities begin to upstage our human in- telligence at the end of the 2030s, we will be able to move beyond the basic architec- ture of the brain‘s neural regions. but artifi- cial intelligence will be based, at least in part, on a human-made version of a fully functional human brain.  ties, memories, and overall thinking capacity, as well as to directly interface with powerful forms of computer intelligence. the technology will also provide wireless communication from one brain to another.  in other words, the age of telepathic communication is almost upon us.  our brains today are rela- tively fixed in design. al- though we do add patterns of interneuronal connec- tions and neurotransmitter concentrations as a normal part of the learning process, the current overall capacity of the human brain is highly constrained. as humanity’s artificial-intelligence (ai) capabilities begin to upstage our human intelligence at the end of the 20305, we will be able to move be- yond the basic architecture of the brain’s neural regions.  brain implants based on massively distributed intelligent nanobots will greatly expand our memories and otherwise vastly improve all of our sensory, pattern-recognition, and cognitive abilities. since the nanobots will be communicating with one an- other, they will be able to create any set of new neural connections, break existing connections (by suppressing neural firing), create new hybrid bio- logical and computer networks, and add completely mechanical net- works, as well as interface intimately with new computer programs and artificial intelligences.  the implementation of artificial in- telligence in our biological systems will mark an evolutionary leap for- ward for humanity, but it also im- plies we will indeed become more ”machine” than ”human.” billions of nanobots will travel through the bloodstream in our bodies and brains. in our bodies, they will de- stroy pathogens, correct dna errors, eliminate toxins, and perform many other tasks to enhance our physical well-being. as a result, we will be able to live indefinitely without aging.  in our brains, nanobots will inter- act with our biological neurons. this will provide full-immersion virtual reality incorporating all of the  the futurist march—april 2006  ‘3  illustration: patrick tucker, wfs / images: photoscom     senses, as well as neurological corre- lates of our emotions, from within the nervous system. more impor- tantly, this intimate connection between our biological thinking and the machine intelligence we are cre- ating will profoundly expand human intelligence.  warfare will move toward nanobot- based weapons, as well as cyberweapons. learning will first move online, but once our brains are fully online we will be able to down- load new knowledge and skills. the role of work will be to create knowledge of all kinds, from music and art to math and science. the role of play will also be to create knowledge. in the future, there won’t be a clear distinction between  work and play.  the robotic revolution  of the three technological revolu- tions underlying the singularity (genetic, nano-mechanical, and ro- botic), the most profound is robotic or, as it is commonly called, the strong artiﬁcial intelligence revolution. this refers to the creation of com- puter thinking ability that exceeds the thinking ability of humans. we are very close to the day when fully biological humans (as we now know them) cease to be the dominant intel- ligence on the planet. by the end of this century, computational or me- chanical intelligence will be trillions of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human brain power. i argue that computer, or as i call it nonbiological intelligence, should still  www. wfs. org 43', 'be considered human since it is fully derived from human—machine civi- lization and will be based, at least in part, on a human-made version of a fully functional human brain. the merger of these two worlds of intelli- gence is not merely a merger of bio- logical and mechanical thinking mediums, but also (and more impor- tantly) a merger of method and orga- nizational thinking that will expand our minds in virtually every imagi- nable way.  biological human thinking is lim- ited to 1016 calculations per second (cps) per human brain (based on neuromorphic modeling of brain regions) and about 1026 cps for all human brains. these figures will not appreciably change, even with bio- engineering adjustments to our genome. the processing capacity of nonbiological intelligence or strong ai, in contrast, is growing at an ex- ponential rate (with the rate itself increasing) and will vastly exceed biological intelligence by the mid- 2040s.  artificial intelligence will neces- sarily exceed human intelligence for several reasons. first, machines can share knowledge and communicate with one another far more efficiently than can humans. as humans, we do not have the means to exchange the vast patterns of interneuronal con- nections and neurotransmitter-con- centration levels that comprise our learning, knowledge, and skills, other than through slow, language- based communication.  second, humanity’s intellectual skills have developed in ways that have been evolutionarily encouraged in natural environments. those skills, which are primarily based on our abilities to recognize and extract meaning from patterns, enable us to be highly proficient in certain tasks, such as distinguishing faces, identi- fying objects, and recognizing lan- guage sounds. unfortunately, our brains are less well-suited for deal- ing with more-complex patterns, such as those that exist in financial, scientific, or product data. the appli- cation of computer-based techniques will allow us to fully master pattern- recognition paradigms. finally, as human knowledge migrates to the web, machines will demonstrate  44 the futurist march—apri12006  increased proficiency in reading, un- derstanding, and synthesizing all human—machine information.  the chicken or the egg  a key question regarding the sin- gularity is whether the ”chicken" (strong ai) or the ”egg” (nanotech- nology) will come first. in other words, will strong ai lead to full nanotechnology (molecular-manu- facturing assemblers that can turn information into physical products), or will full nanotechnology lead to strong ai?  the logic of the first premise is that strong ai would be in a position to solve any remaining design prob- lems required to implement full nanotechnology. the second premise is based on the assumption that hardware requirements for strong ai will be met by nanotechnology- based computation. likewise, the software requirements for engineer- ing strong ai would be facilitated by nanobots. these microscopic ma- chines will allow us to create highly detailed scans of human brains along with diagrams of how the human brain is able to do all the wonderful things that have long mystified us, such as create meaning, contextualize information, and expe- rience emotion. once we fully un- derstand how the brain functions, we will be able to recreate the phe- nomenon of human thinking in ma- chines. we will endow computers, already superior to us in the per- formance of mechanical tasks, with lifelike intelligence.  progress in both areas (nano and robotic) will necessarily use our most-advanced tools, so advances in each field will simultaneously facili- tate the other. however, i do expect that the most important nanotechno- logical breakthroughs will emerge prior to strong ai, but only by a few years (around 2025 for nanotech- nology and 2029 for strong ai).  as revolutionary as nanotech- nology will be, strong ai will have far more profound consequences. nanotechnology is powerful but not necessarily intelligent. we can devise ways of at least trying to manage the enormous powers of nanotech- nology, but superintelligence by its  www. wfs. org  nature cannot be controlled.  the nano / robotic revolution will also force us to reconsider the very definition of human. not only will we be surrounded by machines that will display distinctly human char- acteristics, but also we will be less human from a literal standpoint.  despite the wonderful future po- tential of medicine, real human longevity will only be attained when we move away from our biological bodies entirely. as we move toward a software-based existence, we will gain the means of ”backing our- selves up” (storing the key patterns underlying our knowledge, skills, and personality in a digital setting) thereby enabling a virtual immortal- ity. thanks to nanotechnology, we will have bodies that we can not only modify, but also change into new forms at will. we will be able to quickly change our bodies in full-im- mersion virtual-reality environments incorporating all of the senses dur- ing the 2020s and in real reality in the 2040s.  implications of the singularity  what will be the nature of human experience once computer intelli- gence predominates? what are the implications for the human—machine civilization when strong ai and nanotechnology can create any prod- uct, any situation, any environment that we can imagine at will? i stress the role of imagination here because we will still be constrained in our creations to what we can imagine. but our tools for bringing imagina- tion to life are growing exponentially more powerful.  people often go through three stages in considering the impact of future technology: awe and wonder- ment at its potential to overcome age-old problems, then a sense of dread at the grave new dangers that accompany these novel technologies, followed finally by the realization that the only viable and responsible path is to set a careful course that can realize the benefits while manag- ing the dangers.  my own expectation is that the creative and constructive applica- tions of these technologies will dom- inate, as i believe they do today.', 'however, we need to vastly increase our investment in developing spe- cific defensive technologies. we are at the critical stage where we need to directly implement defensive tech- nologies for nanotechnology during the late teen years of this century.  i believe that a narrow relinquish- ment of the development of certain capabilities needs to be part of our ethical response to the dangers of twenty-first-century technological challenges. for example, bill joy and i wrote a joint op-ed piece in the new york times recently, criticizing the publication of the 1918 flu genome on the web because it constitutes a dangerous blueprint. another con- structive example of this are the ethical guidelines proposed by the foresight institute: namely, that nano- technologists agree to relinquish the  development of physical entities that can self-replicate in a natural envi- ronment free of any human control or override mechanism. however, deciding in favor of too many limita- tions and restrictions would under- mine economic progress and is ethically unjustified, given the op- portunity to alleviate disease, over- come poverty, and clean up the environment.  we don’t have to look past today to see the intertwined promise and peril of technological advancement. imagine describing the dangers (atomic and hydrogen bombs, for one thing) that exist today to people who lived a couple of hundred years ago. they would think it mad to take such risks. but how many people in 2006 would really want to go back to the short, brutish, disease-filled,  the futufiist march—april 2006  poverty-stricken, disaster-prone lives that 99% of the human race strug- gled through two centuries ago?  we may romanticize the past, but up until fairly recently most of hu- manity lived extremely fragile lives in which one all-too-common mis- fortune could spell disaster. two hundred years ago, life expectancy for females in the record-holding country (sweden) was roughly 35 years—very brief compared with the longest life expectancy today, almost 85 years for japanese women. life expectancy for males was roughly 33 years, compared with the current 79 years. half a day was often required to prepare an evening meal, and hard labor characterized most human activity. there were no social safety nets. substantial portions of our species still live in this precari-  wwi/ll.', 'ous way, which is at least one reason to continue technological progress and the economic improvement that accompanies it. only technology, with its ability to provide orders of magnitude of advances in capability and affordability, has the scale to confront problems such as poverty, disease, pollution, and the other overriding concerns of society today. the benefits of applying ourselves to these challenges cannot be over- stated.  as the singularity approaches, we will have to reconsider our ideas about the nature of human life and redesign our human institutions. in- telligence on and around earth will continue to expand exponentially until we reach the limits of matter and energy to support intelligent computation. as we approach this limit in our corner of the galaxy, the intelligence of our civilization will expand outward into the rest of the  universe, quickly reaching the fastest speed possible. we understand that speed to be the speed of light, but there are suggestions that we may be able to circumvent this apparent limit (conceivably by taking short- cuts through ”wormholes,” or hypo- thetical shortcuts through space and time).  a common view is that science has consistently been correcting our overly inﬂated view of our own sig- nificance. stephen jay gould said, ”the most important scientific revo- lutions all include, as their only com- mon feature, the dethronement of human arrogance from one pedestal after another of previous convictions about our centrality in the cosmos.”  instead, it turns out we are central. our ability to create models—virtual realities—in our brains, combined with our modest-looking thumbs, has been sufficient to usher in an- other form of evolution: technology.  technology and human enhancement  i have a few differences of opinion with kurzweil  about the coming singularity.  i think he is being overly optimistic about biotechnol-     the common notion that the ”future can’t be predicted” is demonstrably false with regard to a wide number of accelerat-  that development enabled the per- sistence of the accelerating pace that started with biological evolution. it may continue until the entire uni- verse is at our fingertips.  about the author  ray kurzweil is a scientist, inventor, and entrepreneur. he has received 12 hon- orary doctorates in science, engineering, music, and hu- mane letters from rensse- iaer polytechnic institute, hofstra university, and other leading col- leges and universities. he has been in- ducted into the national inventors hall of fame and received the 1999 national medal of technology, among numerous other awards. his web site, www.kurzweilal .net, has more than a million readers and includes a free daily e-newsletter. this article draws, in part, on his most recent book, the singularity is near: when humans transcend biology (viking, 2005).  by iohn smart  ogy’s ability to create substantially better biological human beings. while we’ll certainly learn to push human capacities to their natural limits in coming decades, i see nothing on the horizon that would allow us to exceed those limits. biology seems far too frail, slow, complex, and well defended (both at the molecular level and with regard to social custom) for that to be plausible within any reasonable time frame. further- more, by the time we are able to substantially improve our biology, we probably won’t want to, as there will be far more interesting and powerful technological environ- ments available to us instead. this points to the impor- tance of understanding the relative accelerations of vari- ous technologies (in this case, biological vs. technological).  in his book, kurzweil makes a major contribution to the literature on acceleration studies by clearly explain- ing technological acceleration curves. these acceleration curves show that the longer we use a technology, the more we get out of it: we use less energy, space, and time, and we get more capacity for less cost. technologi- cal acceleration curves are a little-understood area, but thanks to pioneers like kurzweil, interest and research in the field are advancing.  46 the futurist march—apri12006 www.wfs.org     ing physical-computational trends, even though we do not yet know specifically how those tech- nologies will be implemented. we can no longer ignore the profound technological changes occurring all around us.  it’s also time we acknowledged the slowness of human biology compared with our technological progeny. our machines are increasingly exceeding us in the perform- ance of more and more tasks, from guiding objects like missiles or satellites to assembling other machines. they are merging with us ever more intimately and are learn- ing how to reconfigure our biology in new and signifi- cantly faster technological domains.  something very interesting is happening, and human beings are selective catalysts, not absolute controllers, of this process. let us face this openly, and investigate it ac- tively, so that we may guide these developments as wisely as possible.     about the author  john

thereafter i met him in person at a foresight event, and he had read the review. he told me, ”of all the people who reviewed my book, you were the only one who said i was too conservative!”  the singularity is near is very well researched, and in general, kurzweil’s predictions are about as good as it’s possible to get for things that far in advance. i still think he’s too conservative in one specific area: synthetic com- puter-based artificial intelligence will become available well before nanotechnology makes neuron-level brain scans possible in the 2020s.  what’s happening is that existing technologies like functional mri are beginning to give us a high-level functional block diagram of the brain’s processes. at the same time, the hardware capable of running a strong, ar- tificially intelligent computer, by most estimates, is here now, though it’s still pricey.  existing ai software techniques can build programs that are experts in any well-defined field. the break- throughs necessary for such programs to learn for them- selves could happen easily in the next decade—one or two decades before kurzweil predicts.  kurzweil finesses the issue of runaway ai by propos- ing a pathway where machine intelligence is patterned  nanofactories, gang wars, and “feelies”  a quarter century ago, we’d have laughed at the prospect of ”dick tracy" cell phones with cameras; now they’re everywhere, and nobody noticed after the first few days. so the jump to the idea of a singularity is not really extraordinary. but should we really expect ever more substantial changes to follow the same accelerat- ing, headlong pace?  it’s reasonable to expect affordable computers to be smaller and more powerful, 1,000 times improved in a decade, one million times in 20 years, one billion in 30. by then, some ma- chines might have capabilities to rival the human mind. a new intelligent species might share the planet with us.  in addition, developing technologies such as molecu- lar manufacture—nanotechnology—will allow the very engines of productivity to be copied cheaply and distrib- uted widely. if that happens the gap between rich and poor might diminish. however, it will only occur if we find ways to prevent portable nanofactories from making lethal weapons available to any child or psychopath. we’ll be able to solve most of the problems that currently vex us—global warming (to the extent that it’s caused by humans), water and food shortages, provision of clean, cheap power, and so on.  there is a scary downside that i discussed nearly a decade ago in my book the spike: dirt-cheap molecular manufacturing may end poverty and strife, but there ex- ists a risk that a world of lotus-eaters will degenerate  by i. storrs hall     after human brains, so that they would have our morals and values built in. in- deed, this would clearly be the wise and prudent course. unfortunately, it seems all too likely that a shortcut exists without that kind of safe- guard. corporations already use huge computer systems for data mining and decision support that employ so- phisticated algorithms no human manager understands. it’s a very short step to having such a system make better decisions than the managers do, as far as the corpora- tion’s bottom line is concerned.  the singularity may mean different things to different people. to me, it is that point where intelligences signifi- cantly greater than our own control so many of the es- sential processes that figure in our lives that mere humans can’t predict what happens next. this future may be even nearer than ray kurzweil has predicted.     about the author j. storrs hall is chief scientist of nanorex inc. and a fellow of the molecular engineering research institute. his address is nanorex

(young men especially) with full bellies gained effortlessly, but lacking meaning in their lives, often find purpose in ganging up on each other in fits of murderous primate chest-pounding. making huxleian soma, or ”feelies,” the opiate of the people might help, but that, too, is a sickening prospect.  on the other hand, those strictly unforeseeable and mysterious changes captured in the word ”singularity" are likely to overwhelm and surpass such predictable downsides of any technological utopia or dystopia. the eeriest aspect of accelerating change is that we ourselves, and our children, will be the ones soaking in it. the sooner we start thinking seriously about the prospect, the better prepared we’ll be.     about the author  damien broderick is a senior fellow in the department of

vision repre- sented by the singularity; almost no one is. in my sur- veys over the past decade, i found dwindling minorities of young people (one-fifth to one-quarter) believe in the sort of technical fixes to human problems that ray kurzweil champions, while an increased majority (about three-quarters) believe science and technology are alien- ating people from each other and from nature.  the question i ask is, why? why pursue this future? i don’t pose this question dismissively, or derogatorily, but out of genuine curiosity and a desire for an open, honest conversation. i’m skeptical of arguments that say pre- technological humans led short, nasty, and brutish lives. yes, life expectancy was lower—mainly because of high  by richard eckersley  rates of infant mortality—but those who survived often lived socially and spiritu- ally rich lives. it doesn’t make evolution- i ,5.- ary sense to believe humans lived in mis- 1‘ ery until we discovered technological progress. animals in the wild don’t live that way, and humans have been, for most of their history, animals in the wild.  the future world that kurzweil describes bears almost no relationship to human well-being that i am aware of. in essence, human health and happiness comes from being connected and engaged, from being suspended in a web of relationships and interests—personal, social, and spiritual—that give meaning to our lives. the inti- macy and support provided by close personal relation- ships seem to matter most; isolation exacts the highest        ra y kurzweil reponds:  richard eckersley’s idyllic notion of human life hundreds of years ago belies our scientific knowledge of history. two hundred years ago, there was no under- standing of sanitation, so bacterial in- fections were rampant. there were no antibiotics and no social safety nets, so an infectious disease was a disaster plunging a family into desperation. thomas hobbes’s characterization in 1651 of human life as solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short was on the mark. even ignoring infant mortality, life expectancy was in the 30s only a couple of hundred years ago. schubert’s and mozart’s deaths at 31 and 35 respectively were typical.  eckersley bases his romanticized idea of ancient life on com- munication and the relationships fostered by communication. but much of modern technology is directed at just this basic human need. the telephone allowed people to be together even if far apart geographically. the internet is the quintessential communication technology. social networks and the panoply of new ways to make connection are creating communities based on genuine common interests rather than the accident of geography.  this decentralized electronic communication is also highly de- mocratizing. in a book i wrote in the mid-1980s, i predicted the demise of the soviet union from the impact of the then-emerging communication networks, and that is indeed what happened in the early 1990s. the democracy movement we saw in the 1990s and since is similarly fueled by our unprecedented abilities to stay in touch.  if eckersley really sticks to his own philosophy, he won’t be around for very long to inﬂuence the debate. but i hope that he will take advantage of the life extension—and enhancement— technologies that will emerge in the decades ahead, so that we can continue this dialogue through this century and beyond. u  48 the futuhlst march—apri12006 www.wfs.org     price. the need to belong is more im- portant than the need to be rich. meaning matters more than money and what it buys.  we are left with the matter of des- tiny: it is our preordained fate, kurzweil suggests, to advance tech- nologically ”until the entire universe is at our fingertips.” the question then becomes, preordained by whom or what? biological evolution has not set this course for us. is tech- nology itself the planner? perhaps it will eventually be, but not yet. is god the entity doing the ordaining? a lot of religious people would have something to say about that, and are likely to strenuously, and even vio- lently, oppose what the singularity promises, as i have argued before (the futurist, november-december 2001).  we are left to conclude that we will do this because it is we who have decided it is our destiny. but we have made no such decision, really, as the observations with which i began this commentary show.  about the author  richard eckersley is a fellow at the national centre for epidemiology and population health at the australian national university, canberra,
