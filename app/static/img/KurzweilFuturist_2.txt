[u"The Singularity and Human Destiny\nby Patrick Tucker, \ufb02ssistant Editor, THE fUTUBIST\n\nIn 1949, several decades before the birth of the\nPC, computer scientist John von Neumann an-\nnounced, \u201dIt would appear we have reached the\nlimits of what is possible to achieve with com-\nputer technology. \u201d He quickly and prudently\nadded, \u201dOne should be careful with such state-\nments; they tend to sound pretty silly in five\nyears.\u201d\n\nMore than half a century later, it is Neumann\u2019s\ncaveat rather than his prediction that is borne out\ndaily. Our computer intelligence is growing at an\never-quickening pace, surpassed only by our de\u2014\npendence on computer technology. For many of\nus, computers and computer\u2014based devices have\nbecome not so much tools as appendages, third\narms that are integral to our lives, cumbersome on\noccasion, and increasingly willful. This begs the\nobvious question: If computer power advances be-\nyond our control, how will that change us?\n\nIn his most recent book, The Singularity Is Near,\nauthor and inventor Ray Kurzweil provides us\nwith a clue. Imagine that with the help of a small\ndevice you could create a perfect replica of any ob\u2014\nject\u2014Gianlorenzo Bernini's David, the hub cap\nfrom a '78 Dodge Dart\u2014seemingly from vapor.\nImagine that through virtual-reality software you\nwon\u2019t be shackled to a particular position in time,\nand could exist in several locations at once\u2014work,\nhome, a seaside bungalow in Bora Bora\u2014and each\nsetting in which you chose to locate yourself\nlooked, sounded, and felt perfectly real. Imagine\nthat you could live indefinitely in a world in which\nall poverty, pollution, and scarcity has been van-\nquished. Imagine that there existed no limitation to\nwhat you could do or be, except for those limita\u2014\ntions that you imposed yourself.\n\nThis scenario may sound like a cross between\n\nThomas Moore\u2019s Utopia and Christopher\nMarlow\u2019s Doctor Faustus, but according to Ray\nKurzweil it is our real and fast\u2014approaching\nfuture. It will come about as the result of an ex-\nplosion in our technological abilities. We will in\u2014\ncorporate more computer-based processes into\nour biological functioning until we transcend\nour crude, earthly bodies entirely and become\nmachine-based, virtually immortal. This coming\nperiod of rapid technological progress and its\nmiraculous effects will occur within the next 50\nyears and is what Kurzweil refers to as the\nSingularity.\n\nThe concept is both startling and optimistic,\nbut it immediately provokes certain philosophi\u2014\ncal concerns. If nanotechnology allows us to\ncreate any object, will any object ever again be\nvaluable? What role will responsibility, temper\u2014\nance, and discipline play in a world where any\nurge can be gratified at almost the same moment\nit is felt? What will pass for morality when there\nis no mortal consequence to any action?\n\nThese questions cannot and should not be an-\nswered all at once\u2014either by Ray Kurzweil,\nhis devotees, or his critics. Rather, what is im\u2014\nportant is that they be asked, repeatedly and\nearnestly, and by as many people as possible.\n\nTo further the debate of these key issues, THE\nFUTURIST presents Kurzweil\u2019s insights and\nideas along with invited commentaries from\nnanotechnology expert J. Storrs Hall, accelera-\ntion studies scholar John Smart, and soci-\nologists Damien Broderick and Richard\nEckersely. Together, they examine this issue of\nthe Singularity to determine how near it is\nexactly, and explore what it might mean for\nhumanity\n\nOrder the March\u2014Apri12006 issue of THE FUTURIST from https: / /www.wfs.org/futuristorderhtm.", u'@2006 World Future Society 0 7910 Woodmont Avenue, Suite 450, Bethesda, MD 20814, U.S.A. 0 All rights reserved.\n\nReinventing Humanity:\n\nThe future of machine\u2014Human\nIntelligence By Ray lturzweil\n\n    \n   \n\n\ufb02uthor and inventor Ray Itulzweil sees a\nradical evolution of the human species in the\nnext 40 years.\n\nWe stand on the threshold of the most profound\nand transformative event in the history of humanity,\nthe \u201dSingularity.\u201d\n\nWhat is the Singularity? From my perspective, the\nSingularity is a future period during which the pace\nof technological change will be so fast and far-reach-\ning that human existence on this planet will be\nirreversibly altered. We will combine our brain\npower\u2014the knowledge, skills, and personality quirks\nthat make us human\u2014with our computer power in\norder to think, reason, communicate, and create in\nways we can scarcely even contemplate today.\n\nThis merger of man and machine, coupled with the\nsudden explosion in machine intelligence and rapid\ninnovation in gene research and nanotechnology, will\nresult in a world where there is no distinction between\nthe biological and the mechanical, or between physi-\ncal and virtual reality. These technological revolutions\nwill allow us to transcend our frail bodies with all\ntheir limitations. Illness, as we know it, will be eradi-\ncated. Through the use of nanotechnology, we will be\nable to manufacture almost any physical product\nupon demand, world hunger and poverty will be\nsolved, and pollution will vanish. Human existence\nwill undergo a quantum leap in evolution. We will be\n\nTHE FUTURIST March\u2014April 2006 39', u'able to live as long as we choose. The\ncoming into being of such a world is,\nin essence, the Singularity.\n\nHow is it possible that we could be\nso close to this enormous change\nand not see it? The answer is the\nquickening nature of technological\ninnovation. In thinking about the\nfuture, few people take into consid-\neration the fact that human scientific\nprogress is exponential: It expands\nby repeatedly multiplying by a con-\nstant (10 times 10 times 10, and so\non) rather than linear (10 plus 10\nplus 10, and so on). I emphasize the\nexponential-versus-linear perspec-\ntive because it\u2019s the most important\nfailure that prognosticators make in\nconsidering future trends.\n\nOur forebears expected what lay\nahead of them to resemble what they\nhad already experienced, with few\nexceptions. Because they lived dur-\ning a time when the rate of techno-\nlogical innovation was so slow as to\nbe unnoticeable, their expectations of\nan unchanged future were continu-\nally fulfilled. Today, we have wit-\nnessed the acceleration of the curve.\nTherefore, we anticipate continuous\ntechnological progress and the social\nrepercussions that follow. We see the\nfuture as being different from the\npresent. But the future will be far\nmore surprising than most people\nrealize, because few observers have\ntruly internalized the implications of\nthe fact that the rate of change is\nitself accelerating.\n\nExponential growth starts out\nslowly and virtually unnoticeably,\nbut beyond the knee of the curve it\nturns explosive and profoundly\ntransformative. My models show\nthat we are doubling the paradigm-\nshift rate for technology innovation\nevery decade. In other words, the\ntwentieth century was gradually\nspeeding up to today\u2019s rate of\nprogress; its achievements, therefore,\nwere equivalent to about 20 years of\nprogress at the rate of 2000. We\u2019ll\nmake another \u201d20 years\u201d of progress\nin just 14 years (by 2014), and then\ndo the same again in only seven\nyears. To express this another way,\nwe won\u2019t experience 100 years of\ntechnological advance in the twenty-\nfirst century; we will witness on the\norder of 20,000 years of progress\n(again, when measured by today\u2019s\n\n40 THE FUTURIST March\u2014Apri12006\n\nprogress rate), or progress on a level\nof about 1,000 times greater than\nwhat was achieved in the twentieth\ncentury.\n\nHow Will We Know the\nSingularity ls Upon Us?\n\nThe first half of the twenty-first\ncentury will be characterized by\nthree overlapping revolutions\u2014in\ngenetics, nanotechnology, and robot-\nics. These will usher in the beginning\nof this period of tremendous change\nI refer to as the Singularity. We are in\nthe early stages of the genetics revo-\nlution today. By understanding the\ninformation processes underlying\nlife, we are learning to reprogram\nour biology to achieve the virtual\nelimination of disease, dramatic ex-\npansion of human potential, and\nradical life extension. However,\nHans Moravec of Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity\u2019s Robotics Institute points\nout that, no matter how successfully\nwe fine-tune our DNA-based biol-\nogy, biology will never be able to\nmatch what we will be able to engi-\nneer once we fully understand life\u2019s\nprinciples of operation. In other\nwords, we will always be \u201dsecond-\nclass robots.\u201d\n\nThe nanotechnology revolution\nwill enable us to redesign and re-\nbuild\u2014molecule by molecule\u2014our\nbodies and brains and the world\nwith which we interact, going far be-\nyond the limitations of biology.\n\nBut the most powerful impending\nrevolution is the robotic revolution.\nBy robotic, I am not referring ex-\nclusively\u2014or even primarily\u2014to\nhumanoid-looking droids that take\nup physical space, but rather to arti-\nficial intelligence in all its variations.\n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n\nwww. wfs. org\n\nFollowing, I have laid out the prin-\ncipal components underlying each of\nthese coming technological revolu-\ntions. While each new wave of\nprogress will solve the problems\nfrom earlier transformations, each\nwill also introduce new perils. Each,\noperating both separately and in\nconcert, underpins the Singularity.\n\nThe Genetic Revolution\n\nGenetic and molecular science will\nextend biology and correct its obvi-\nous flaws (such as our vulnerability\nto disease). By the year 2020, the full\neffects of the genetic revolution will\nbe felt across society. We are rapidly\ngaining the knowledge and the tools\nto drastically extend the usability of\nthe \u201dhouse" each of us calls his body\nand brain.\n\nNanomedicine researcher Robert\nFreitas estimates that eliminating\n50% of medically preventable condi-\ntions would extend human life ex-\npectancy to 150 years. If we were\nable to prevent 99% of naturally oc-\ncurring medical problems, we\u2019d live\nto be more than 1,000 years old.\n\nWe can see the beginnings of this\nawesome medical revolution today.\nThe field of genetic biotechnology is\nfueled by a growing arsenal of tools.\nDrug discovery was once a matter of\nfinding substrates (chemicals) that\nproduced some beneficial result\nwithout excessive side effects, a\nresearch method similar to early\nhumans\u2019 seeking out rocks and other\nnatural implements that could be\nused for helpful purposes. Today, we\nare discovering the precise biochemi-\ncal pathways that underlie both dis-\nease and aging processes. We are\n\ncontinued on page 42\n\nPHOTOSCOM\n\nIn the future, more drugs will be\ndesigned to carry out precise\nmissions at the molecular level.', u"Bag lturzweil\u2019s Plan for Cheating Death\n\n\ufb02 cure for aging may he found in the next fiftg gears. The trick now is to live\nlong enough to be there when it happens. Here\u2019s how llurzweil is trying to do it.\n\nBy Terry Grossman\n\nI first met Ray Kurzweil in 1999\n\nat a Foresight Institute meeting in\n\nPalo Alto. I was there to get some\n\nbackground information on nano-\n\ntechnology for a new book I was\n\nwriting. As I stood in the lunch\n\nline, a healthy-appearing man in\n\nfront of me was engaged in animated conversa-\n\ntion with a not nearly so healthy-looking second\n\nman. Their topic of conversation was vitamins\n\nand nutritional supplementation, a topic of great\ninterest to me, a nutritionally oriented M.D.\n\nI joined the conversation, and the healthy-\nlooking man introduced himself as Ray\nKurzweil. Ray and I continued our dialogue via\ne-mail after the conference ended, and a few\nmonths later, he \ufb02ew from his home in Boston to\nFrontier Medical Institute, my longevity clinic in\nDenver, for a comprehensive longevity medical\nevaluation. We performed a comprehensive bat-\ntery of tests designed to uncover any health risks\nhe might still have so that together we could op-\ntimize his already very sophisticated program\nfor health and longevity.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was obvious that Ray\nwould be a unique patient. I have many engi-\nneers as patients in my practice (and Ray is an\nengineer by training), so I am not surprised\nwhen patients come to see me with a notebook\nof spreadsheets detailing various data ex-\ntracted from their daily lives: blood pressure,\nweight, cholesterol, blood sugar levels, amount\nof exercise, etc., carefully tabulated for several\nyears. But all previous data collections I had\nseen, even those organized into Excel and\nmeticulously graphed, paled in comparison to\nRay\u2019s. His data collection was so thorough and\nmeticulous that he could tell me what he ate\nfor lunch on June 23, 1989 (as well as what he\nate for lunch every other day for several years\nbefore that time). And not only what he ate,\nbut the number of grams of each serving and\ncalories consumed, as well as the number of\ncalories he burned that day through exercise\u2014\nevery day for decades!\n\nAs a result, it came as less of a surprise for me\n\nto learn that Ray was taking over 200 supple-\nment pills a day. Ray\u2019s approach had been to ac-\ncurately assess his personal health risks and then\nquite simply to \u201dreprogram his biochemistry.\u201d\nOngoing testing indicates that he is doing a re-\nmarkable job, as measurement of his biological\nage in my clinic indicates that he is now almost\ntwo decades younger than his chronological age,\nand all of his health risks appear under optimal\ncontrol.\n\nRay was already working on his new book, The\nSingularity Is Near, at that time, and I had just\ncompleted my first book, The Baby Boomers' Guide\nto Living Forever. It was natural that our e-mail di-\nalogue moved into discussion of the prospects\nfor truly radical life extension for people of all\nages, including older boomers like ourselves. As\nour e-mails multiplied into the many thousands,\nwe decided to organize the information and see\nif we had the makings of a new book that we\nwould co-author. I created a preliminary table of\ncontents, Ray organized the information from\nour e-mails, and, another 10,000 e-mails or so\nlater, our joint book, Fantastic Voyage: Live Long\nEnough to Live Forever, was written in the midst of\nRay\u2019s writing of The Singularity Is Near.\n\nRay felt that he was writing these books to-\ngether as a unit and that there was synergy\nbetween them. The Singularity Is Near details\nRay\u2019s vision of the astounding possibilities of the\nworld of the near future as the Singularity un-\nfolds sometime within the next few decades. In\nFantastic Voyage, we provide readers with the in-\nformation they need to live long enough and\nremain healthy enough to fully experience the\nwonders of life in the post-Singularity world. In\nwriting these two books, Ray has painted a clear\npicture of the future and provided a blueprint for\nhow to get there.\n\n \n\nAbout the Author\n\nTerry Grossman, M.D., is the founder and medical director\nof Frontier Medical Institute in Denver, Colorado.

Gene expression is the\nprocess by which cellular compo-\nnents (specifically RNA and the ribo-\nsomes) produce proteins according\nto a precise genetic blueprint. While\nevery human cell contains a com-\nplete DNA sample, and thus the full\ncomplement of the body\u2019s genes, a\nspecific cell, such as a skin cell or a\npancreatic islet cell, gets its charac-\nteristics from only the fraction of\ngenetic information relevant to that\nparticular cell type.\n\nGene expression is controlled by\npeptides (molecules made up of se-\nquences of up to 100 amino acids)\nand short RNA strands. We are now\nbeginning to learn how these\nprocesses work. Many new therapies\ncurrently in development and testing\nare based on manipulating peptides\neither to turn off the expression of\ndisease-causing genes or to turn on\ndesirable genes that may otherwise\nnot be expressed in a particular type\nof cell. A new technique called RNA\ninterference is able to destroy the\nmessenger RNA expressing a gene\nand thereby effectively turn that\ngene off.\n\nAccelerating progress in biotech-\nnology will enable us to reprogram\nour genes and metabolic processes to\npropel the fields of genomics (influ-\nencing genes), proteomics (under-\nstanding and influencing the role of\nproteins), gene therapy (suppressing\ngene expression as well as adding\nnew genetic information), rational\ndrug design (formulating drugs that\ntarget precise changes in disease and\naging processes), as well as the ther-\napeutic cloning of rejuvenated cells,\ntissues, and organs.\n\nThe Nanotechnology Revolution\n\nNanotechnology promises the\ntools to rebuild the physical world,\nour bodies, and our brains, molecu-\nlar fragment by molecular fragment\nand potentially atom by atom.

At this rate, the\nkey feature sizes for most electronic\nand many mechanical technologies\nwill be in the nanotechnology\nrange\u2014generally considered to be\nless than 100 nanometers (one-\nbillionth of one meter)\u2014by the\n2020s. Electronics has already\ndipped below this threshold, al-\nthough not yet in three-dimensional\nstructures and not yet in structures\nthat are capable of assembling other\nsimilar structures, an essential step\nbefore nanotechnology can reach its\npromised potential. Meanwhile,\nrapid progress has been made re-\ncently in preparing the conceptual\nframework and design ideas for the\ncoming age of nanotechnology.\n\nNanotechnology has expanded to\ninclude any technology in which a\nmachine\u2019s key features are measured\nby fewer than 100 nanometers. Just\nas contemporary electronics has al-\nready quietly slipped into this nano\nrealm, the area of biological and\nmedical applications has already en-\ntered the era of nanoparticles, in\nwhich nanoscale objects are being\ndeveloped to create more-effective\ntests and treatments.\n\nIn the area of testing and diagno-\nsis, nanoparticles are being em-\nployed in experimental biological\ntests as tags and labels to greatly en-\nhance sensitivity in detecting sub-\nstances such as proteins. Magnetic\nnanotags can be used to bind with\nantibodies that can then be read us-\ning magnetic probes while still in-\nside the body. Successful experi-\nments have been conducted with\ngold nanoparticles that are bound to\n\nwww. wfs. org\n\nDNA segments and can rapidly test\nfor specific DNA sequences in a\nsample. Small nanoscale beads\ncalled quantum dots can be pro-\ngrammed with specific codes com-\nbining multiple colors, similar to a\ncolor bar code, that can facilitate\ntracking of substances through the\nbody.\n\nIn the future, nanoscale devices\nwill run hundreds of tests simultane-\nously on tiny samples of a given sub-\nstance. These devices will allow ex-\ntensive tests to be conducted on\nnearly invisible samples of blood.\n\nIn the area of treatment, a particu-\nlarly exciting application of this tech-\nnology is the harnessing of nanopar-\nticles to deliver medication to\nspecific sites in the body. Nanopar-\nticles can guide drugs into cell walls\nand through the blood-brain barrier.\nNanoscale packages can be designed\nto hold drugs, protect them through\nthe gastrointestinal tract, ferry them\nto specific locations, and then release\nthem in sophisticated ways that can\nbe influenced and controlled, wire-\nlessly, from outside the body.\n\nNanotherapeutics in Alachua,\nFlorida, has developed a biodegrad-\nable polymer only several nanome-\nters thick that uses this approach.\nMeanwhile, scientists at McGill Uni-\nversity in Montreal have demon-\nstrated a nanopill with structures in\nthe 25 to 45 nanometer range. The\nnanopill is small enough to pass\nthrough the cell wall and deliver\nmedications directly to targeted\nstructures inside the cell.\n\nMicroCHIPS of Bedford, Massa-\nchusetts, has developed a computer-\nized device that is implanted under\nthe skin and delivers precise mix-\ntures of medicines from hundreds of\nnanoscale wells inside the device.\nFuture versions of the device are ex-\npected to be able to measure blood\nlevels of substances such as glucose.\nThe system could be used as an arti-\nficial pancreas, releasing precise\namounts of insulin based on the\nblood glucose response. The system\nwould also be capable of simulating\nany other hormone-producing or-\ngan. If trials go smoothly, the system\ncould be on the market by 2008. An-\nother innovative proposal is to guide\nnanoparticles (probably composed of\ngold) to a tumor site and then heat', u'them with infrared beams to destroy\nthe cancer cells.\n\nThe revolution in nanotechnology\nwill allow us to do a great deal more\nthan simply treat disease. Ultimately,\nnanotech will enable us to redesign\nand rebuild not only our bodies and\nbrains, but also the world with\nwhich we interact. The full realiza-\ntion of nanotechnology, however,\nwill lag behind the biotechnology\nrevolution by about one decade. But\nby the mid to late 2020s, the effects\nof the nanotech revolution will be\nwidespread and obvious.\n\nNanotechnology and\nThe Human Brain\n\nThe most important and radical\napplication particularly of circa-2030\nnanobots will be to expand our\nminds through the merger of bio-\nlogical and nonbiological, or \u201dma-\nchine," intelligence. In the next 25\nyears, we will learn how to augment\nour 100 trillion very slow inter-\nneuronal connections with high-\nspeed virtual connections via nano-\nrobotics.

As humanity\u2019s artificial-intelligence (AI)\ncapabilities begin to upstage our human in-\ntelligence at the end of the 2030s, we will\nbe able to move beyond the basic architec-\nture of the brain\u2018s neural regions.

The technology\nwill also provide wireless\ncommunication from one\nbrain to another.\n\nIn other words, the age of\ntelepathic communication is\nalmost upon us.\n\nOur brains today are rela-\ntively fixed in design. Al-\nthough we do add patterns\nof interneuronal connec-\ntions and neurotransmitter\nconcentrations as a normal\npart of the learning process,\nthe current overall capacity of the\nhuman brain is highly constrained.\nAs humanity\u2019s artificial-intelligence\n(AI) capabilities begin to upstage our\nhuman intelligence at the end of the\n20305, we will be able to move be-\nyond the basic architecture of the\nbrain\u2019s neural regions.\n\nBrain implants based on massively\ndistributed intelligent nanobots will\ngreatly expand our memories and\notherwise vastly improve all of our\nsensory, pattern-recognition, and\ncognitive abilities. Since the nanobots\nwill be communicating with one an-\nother, they will be able to create any\nset of new neural connections, break\nexisting connections (by suppressing\nneural firing), create new hybrid bio-\nlogical and computer networks, and\nadd completely mechanical net-\nworks, as well as interface intimately\nwith new computer programs and\nartificial intelligences.\n\nThe implementation of artificial in-\ntelligence in our biological systems\nwill mark an evolutionary leap for-\nward for humanity, but it also im-\nplies we will indeed become more\n\u201dmachine\u201d than \u201dhuman.\u201d Billions of\nnanobots will travel through the\nbloodstream in our bodies and\nbrains. In our bodies, they will de-\nstroy pathogens, correct DNA errors,\neliminate toxins, and perform many\nother tasks to enhance our physical\nwell-being. As a result, we will be\nable to live indefinitely without\naging.\n\nIn our brains, nanobots will inter-\nact with our biological neurons. This\nwill provide full-immersion virtual\nreality incorporating all of the\n\nTHE FUTURIST March\u2014April 2006\n\n\u20183\n\nILLUSTRATION: PATRICK TUCKER, WFS / IMAGES: PHOTOSCOM\n\n \n\nsenses, as well as neurological corre-\nlates of our emotions, from within\nthe nervous system. More impor-\ntantly, this intimate connection\nbetween our biological thinking and\nthe machine intelligence we are cre-\nating will profoundly expand\nhuman intelligence.\n\nWarfare will move toward nanobot-\nbased weapons, as well as\ncyberweapons. Learning will first\nmove online, but once our brains are\nfully online we will be able to down-\nload new knowledge and skills. The\nrole of work will be to create\nknowledge of all kinds, from music\nand art to math and science. The role\nof play will also be to create\nknowledge. In the future, there\nwon\u2019t be a clear distinction between\n\nwork and play.\n\nThe Robotic Revolution\n\nOf the three technological revolu-\ntions underlying the Singularity\n(genetic, nano-mechanical, and ro-\nbotic), the most profound is robotic\nor, as it is commonly called, the\nstrong arti\ufb01cial intelligence revolution.\nThis refers to the creation of com-\nputer thinking ability that exceeds\nthe thinking ability of humans. We\nare very close to the day when fully\nbiological humans (as we now know\nthem) cease to be the dominant intel-\nligence on the planet. By the end of\nthis century, computational or me-\nchanical intelligence will be trillions\nof trillions of times more powerful\nthan unaided human brain power. I\nargue that computer, or as I call it\nnonbiological intelligence, should still\n\nwww. wfs. org 43', u'be considered human since it is fully\nderived from human\u2014machine civi-\nlization and will be based, at least in\npart, on a human-made version of a\nfully functional human brain. The\nmerger of these two worlds of intelli-\ngence is not merely a merger of bio-\nlogical and mechanical thinking\nmediums, but also (and more impor-\ntantly) a merger of method and orga-\nnizational thinking that will expand\nour minds in virtually every imagi-\nnable way.\n\nBiological human thinking is lim-\nited to 1016 calculations per second\n(cps) per human brain (based on\nneuromorphic modeling of brain\nregions) and about 1026 cps for all\nhuman brains. These figures will not\nappreciably change, even with bio-\nengineering adjustments to our\ngenome. The processing capacity of\nnonbiological intelligence or strong\nAI, in contrast, is growing at an ex-\nponential rate (with the rate itself\nincreasing) and will vastly exceed\nbiological intelligence by the mid-\n2040s.\n\nArtificial intelligence will neces-\nsarily exceed human intelligence for\nseveral reasons. First, machines can\nshare knowledge and communicate\nwith one another far more efficiently\nthan can humans. As humans, we do\nnot have the means to exchange the\nvast patterns of interneuronal con-\nnections and neurotransmitter-con-\ncentration levels that comprise our\nlearning, knowledge, and skills,\nother than through slow, language-\nbased communication.\n\nSecond, humanity\u2019s intellectual\nskills have developed in ways that\nhave been evolutionarily encouraged\nin natural environments. Those\nskills, which are primarily based on\nour abilities to recognize and extract\nmeaning from patterns, enable us to\nbe highly proficient in certain tasks,\nsuch as distinguishing faces, identi-\nfying objects, and recognizing lan-\nguage sounds. Unfortunately, our\nbrains are less well-suited for deal-\ning with more-complex patterns,\nsuch as those that exist in financial,\nscientific, or product data. The appli-\ncation of computer-based techniques\nwill allow us to fully master pattern-\nrecognition paradigms. Finally, as\nhuman knowledge migrates to the\nWeb, machines will demonstrate\n\n44 THE FUTURIST March\u2014Apri12006\n\nincreased proficiency in reading, un-\nderstanding, and synthesizing all\nhuman\u2014machine information.\n\nThe Chicken or the Egg\n\nA key question regarding the Sin-\ngularity is whether the \u201dchicken"\n(strong AI) or the \u201degg\u201d (nanotech-\nnology) will come first. In other\nwords, will strong AI lead to full\nnanotechnology (molecular-manu-\nfacturing assemblers that can turn\ninformation into physical products),\nor will full nanotechnology lead to\nstrong AI?\n\nThe logic of the first premise is\nthat strong AI would be in a position\nto solve any remaining design prob-\nlems required to implement full\nnanotechnology. The second premise\nis based on the assumption that\nhardware requirements for strong AI\nwill be met by nanotechnology-\nbased computation. Likewise, the\nsoftware requirements for engineer-\ning strong AI would be facilitated by\nnanobots. These microscopic ma-\nchines will allow us to create highly\ndetailed scans of human brains\nalong with diagrams of how the\nhuman brain is able to do all the\nwonderful things that have long\nmystified us, such as create meaning,\ncontextualize information, and expe-\nrience emotion. Once we fully un-\nderstand how the brain functions,\nwe will be able to recreate the phe-\nnomenon of human thinking in ma-\nchines. We will endow computers,\nalready superior to us in the per-\nformance of mechanical tasks, with\nlifelike intelligence.\n\nProgress in both areas (nano and\nrobotic) will necessarily use our\nmost-advanced tools, so advances in\neach field will simultaneously facili-\ntate the other. However, I do expect\nthat the most important nanotechno-\nlogical breakthroughs will emerge\nprior to strong AI, but only by a few\nyears (around 2025 for nanotech-\nnology and 2029 for strong AI).\n\nAs revolutionary as nanotech-\nnology will be, strong AI will have\nfar more profound consequences.\nNanotechnology is powerful but not\nnecessarily intelligent. We can devise\nways of at least trying to manage the\nenormous powers of nanotech-\nnology, but superintelligence by its\n\nwww. wfs. org\n\nnature cannot be controlled.\n\nThe nano / robotic revolution will\nalso force us to reconsider the very\ndefinition of human. Not only will\nwe be surrounded by machines that\nwill display distinctly human char-\nacteristics, but also we will be less\nhuman from a literal standpoint.\n\nDespite the wonderful future po-\ntential of medicine, real human\nlongevity will only be attained when\nwe move away from our biological\nbodies entirely. As we move toward\na software-based existence, we will\ngain the means of \u201dbacking our-\nselves up\u201d (storing the key patterns\nunderlying our knowledge, skills,\nand personality in a digital setting)\nthereby enabling a virtual immortal-\nity. Thanks to nanotechnology, we\nwill have bodies that we can not\nonly modify, but also change into\nnew forms at will. We will be able to\nquickly change our bodies in full-im-\nmersion virtual-reality environments\nincorporating all of the senses dur-\ning the 2020s and in real reality in\nthe 2040s.\n\nImplications of the Singularity\n\nWhat will be the nature of human\nexperience once computer intelli-\ngence predominates? What are the\nimplications for the human\u2014machine\ncivilization when strong AI and\nnanotechnology can create any prod-\nuct, any situation, any environment\nthat we can imagine at will? I stress\nthe role of imagination here because\nwe will still be constrained in our\ncreations to what we can imagine.\nBut our tools for bringing imagina-\ntion to life are growing exponentially\nmore powerful.\n\nPeople often go through three\nstages in considering the impact of\nfuture technology: awe and wonder-\nment at its potential to overcome\nage-old problems, then a sense of\ndread at the grave new dangers that\naccompany these novel technologies,\nfollowed finally by the realization\nthat the only viable and responsible\npath is to set a careful course that\ncan realize the benefits while manag-\ning the dangers.\n\nMy own expectation is that the\ncreative and constructive applica-\ntions of these technologies will dom-\ninate, as I believe they do today.', u'However, we need to vastly increase\nour investment in developing spe-\ncific defensive technologies. We are\nat the critical stage where we need to\ndirectly implement defensive tech-\nnologies for nanotechnology during\nthe late teen years of this century.\n\nI believe that a narrow relinquish-\nment of the development of certain\ncapabilities needs to be part of our\nethical response to the dangers of\ntwenty-first-century technological\nchallenges. For example, Bill Joy and\nI wrote a joint op-ed piece in the New\nYork Times recently, criticizing the\npublication of the 1918 flu genome\non the Web because it constitutes a\ndangerous blueprint. Another con-\nstructive example of this are the\nethical guidelines proposed by the\nForesight Institute: namely, that nano-\ntechnologists agree to relinquish the\n\ndevelopment of physical entities that\ncan self-replicate in a natural envi-\nronment free of any human control\nor override mechanism. However,\ndeciding in favor of too many limita-\ntions and restrictions would under-\nmine economic progress and is\nethically unjustified, given the op-\nportunity to alleviate disease, over-\ncome poverty, and clean up the\nenvironment.\n\nWe don\u2019t have to look past today\nto see the intertwined promise and\nperil of technological advancement.\nImagine describing the dangers\n(atomic and hydrogen bombs, for\none thing) that exist today to people\nwho lived a couple of hundred years\nago. They would think it mad to take\nsuch risks. But how many people in\n2006 would really want to go back to\nthe short, brutish, disease-filled,\n\nTHE FUTUFIIST March\u2014April 2006\n\npoverty-stricken, disaster-prone lives\nthat 99% of the human race strug-\ngled through two centuries ago?\n\nWe may romanticize the past, but\nup until fairly recently most of hu-\nmanity lived extremely fragile lives\nin which one all-too-common mis-\nfortune could spell disaster. Two\nhundred years ago, life expectancy\nfor females in the record-holding\ncountry (Sweden) was roughly 35\nyears\u2014very brief compared with the\nlongest life expectancy today, almost\n85 years for Japanese women. Life\nexpectancy for males was roughly 33\nyears, compared with the current 79\nyears. Half a day was often required\nto prepare an evening meal, and\nhard labor characterized most\nhuman activity. There were no social\nsafety nets. Substantial portions of\nour species still live in this precari-\n\nWWI/ll.', u'ous way, which is at least one reason\nto continue technological progress\nand the economic improvement that\naccompanies it. Only technology,\nwith its ability to provide orders of\nmagnitude of advances in capability\nand affordability, has the scale to\nconfront problems such as poverty,\ndisease, pollution, and the other\noverriding concerns of society today.\nThe benefits of applying ourselves to\nthese challenges cannot be over-\nstated.\n\nAs the Singularity approaches, we\nwill have to reconsider our ideas\nabout the nature of human life and\nredesign our human institutions. In-\ntelligence on and around Earth will\ncontinue to expand exponentially\nuntil we reach the limits of matter\nand energy to support intelligent\ncomputation. As we approach this\nlimit in our corner of the galaxy, the\nintelligence of our civilization will\nexpand outward into the rest of the\n\nuniverse, quickly reaching the fastest\nspeed possible. We understand that\nspeed to be the speed of light, but\nthere are suggestions that we may be\nable to circumvent this apparent\nlimit (conceivably by taking short-\ncuts through \u201dwormholes,\u201d or hypo-\nthetical shortcuts through space and\ntime).\n\nA common view is that science has\nconsistently been correcting our\noverly in\ufb02ated view of our own sig-\nnificance. Stephen Jay Gould said,\n\u201dThe most important scientific revo-\nlutions all include, as their only com-\nmon feature, the dethronement of\nhuman arrogance from one pedestal\nafter another of previous convictions\nabout our centrality in the cosmos.\u201d\n\nInstead, it turns out we are central.\nOur ability to create models\u2014virtual\nrealities\u2014in our brains, combined\nwith our modest-looking thumbs,\nhas been sufficient to usher in an-\nother form of evolution: technology.\n\nTechnology and Human Enhancement\n\nI have a few differences of opinion with Kurzweil\n\nabout the coming Singularity.\n\nI think he is being overly optimistic about biotechnol-\n\n \n\nThe common notion that the \u201dfuture\ncan\u2019t be predicted\u201d is demonstrably false\nwith regard to a wide number of accelerat-\n\nThat development enabled the per-\nsistence of the accelerating pace that\nstarted with biological evolution.

While we\u2019ll certainly learn to push\nhuman capacities to their natural limits in coming\ndecades, I see nothing on the horizon that would allow\nus to exceed those limits. Biology seems far too frail,\nslow, complex, and well defended (both at the molecular\nlevel and with regard to social custom) for that to be\nplausible within any reasonable time frame. Further-\nmore, by the time we are able to substantially improve\nour biology, we probably won\u2019t want to, as there will be\nfar more interesting and powerful technological environ-\nments available to us instead. This points to the impor-\ntance of understanding the relative accelerations of vari-\nous technologies (in this case, biological vs.\ntechnological).\n\nIn his book, Kurzweil makes a major contribution to\nthe literature on acceleration studies by clearly explain-\ning technological acceleration curves. These acceleration\ncurves show that the longer we use a technology, the\nmore we get out of it: We use less energy, space, and\ntime, and we get more capacity for less cost. Technologi-\ncal acceleration curves are a little-understood area, but\nthanks to pioneers like Kurzweil, interest and research in\nthe field are advancing.\n\n46 THE FUTURIST March\u2014Apri12006 WWW.Wfs.org\n\n \n\ning physical-computational trends, even\nthough we do not yet know specifically how those tech-\nnologies will be implemented. We can no longer ignore\nthe profound technological changes occurring all around\nus.\n\nIt\u2019s also time we acknowledged the slowness of human\nbiology compared with our technological progeny. Our\nmachines are increasingly exceeding us in the perform-\nance of more and more tasks, from guiding objects like\nmissiles or satellites to assembling other machines. They\nare merging with us ever more intimately and are learn-\ning how to reconfigure our biology in new and signifi-\ncantly faster technological domains.\n\nSomething very interesting is happening, and human\nbeings are selective catalysts, not absolute controllers, of\nthis process.

Shortly thereafter I met him in person\nat a Foresight event, and he had read the review. He told\nme, \u201dOf all the people who reviewed my book, you were\nthe only one who said I was too conservative!\u201d\n\nThe Singularity Is Near is very well researched, and in\ngeneral, Kurzweil\u2019s predictions are about as good as it\u2019s\npossible to get for things that far in advance. I still think\nhe\u2019s too conservative in one specific area: Synthetic com-\nputer-based artificial intelligence will become available\nwell before nanotechnology makes neuron-level brain\nscans possible in the 2020s.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is that existing technologies like\nfunctional MRI are beginning to give us a high-level\nfunctional block diagram of the brain\u2019s processes. At the\nsame time, the hardware capable of running a strong, ar-\ntificially intelligent computer, by most estimates, is here\nnow, though it\u2019s still pricey.\n\nExisting AI software techniques can build programs\nthat are experts in any well-defined field. The break-\nthroughs necessary for such programs to learn for them-\nselves could happen easily in the next decade\u2014one or\ntwo decades before Kurzweil predicts.\n\nKurzweil finesses the issue of runaway AI by propos-\ning a pathway where machine intelligence is patterned\n\nnanofactories, Gang wars, and \u201cfeelies\u201d\n\nA quarter century ago, we\u2019d have laughed at the\nprospect of \u201dDick Tracy" cell phones with cameras; now\nthey\u2019re everywhere, and nobody noticed after the first\nfew days. So the jump to the idea of a Singularity is not\nreally extraordinary. But should we really expect ever\nmore substantial changes to follow the same accelerat-\ning, headlong pace?\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable to expect affordable computers to be smaller\nand more powerful, 1,000 times improved in a decade, one\nmillion times in 20 years, one billion in 30. By then, some ma-\nchines might have capabilities to rival the human mind. A\nnew intelligent species might share the planet with us.\n\nIn addition, developing technologies such as molecu-\nlar manufacture\u2014nanotechnology\u2014will allow the very\nengines of productivity to be copied cheaply and distrib-\nuted widely. If that happens the gap between rich and\npoor might diminish. However, it will only occur if we\nfind ways to prevent portable nanofactories from making\nlethal weapons available to any child or psychopath.\nWe\u2019ll be able to solve most of the problems that currently\nvex us\u2014global warming (to the extent that it\u2019s caused by\nhumans), water and food shortages, provision of clean,\ncheap power, and so on.\n\nThere is a scary downside that I discussed nearly a\ndecade ago in my book The Spike: Dirt-cheap molecular\nmanufacturing may end poverty and strife, but there ex-\nists a risk that a world of lotus-eaters will degenerate\n\nBy I.

Unfortunately, it seems all\ntoo likely that a shortcut exists without that kind of safe-\nguard. Corporations already use huge computer systems\nfor data mining and decision support that employ so-\nphisticated algorithms no human manager understands.\nIt\u2019s a very short step to having such a system make better\ndecisions than the managers do, as far as the corpora-\ntion\u2019s bottom line is concerned.\n\nThe Singularity may mean different things to different\npeople.

In my sur-\nveys over the past decade, I found dwindling minorities\nof young people (one-fifth to one-quarter) believe in the\nsort of technical fixes to human problems that Ray\nKurzweil champions, while an increased majority (about\nthree-quarters) believe science and technology are alien-\nating people from each other and from nature.\n\nThe question I ask is, why? Why pursue this future? I\ndon\u2019t pose this question dismissively, or derogatorily, but\nout of genuine curiosity and a desire for an open, honest\nconversation. I\u2019m skeptical of arguments that say pre-\ntechnological humans led short, nasty, and brutish lives.\nYes, life expectancy was lower\u2014mainly because of high\n\nBy Richard Eckersley\n\nrates of infant mortality\u2014but those who\nsurvived often lived socially and spiritu-\nally rich lives. It doesn\u2019t make evolution- I ,5.-\nary sense to believe humans lived in mis- 1\u2018\nery until we discovered technological progress. Animals\nin the wild don\u2019t live that way, and humans have been,\nfor most of their history, animals in the wild.\n\nThe future world that Kurzweil describes bears almost\nno relationship to human well-being that I am aware of.\nIn essence, human health and happiness comes from\nbeing connected and engaged, from being suspended in\na web of relationships and interests\u2014personal, social,\nand spiritual\u2014that give meaning to our lives. The inti-\nmacy and support provided by close personal relation-\nships seem to matter most; isolation exacts the highest\n\n    \n\nRa y Kurzweil reponds:\n\nRichard Eckersley\u2019s idyllic notion of\nhuman life hundreds of years ago belies\nour scientific knowledge of history. Two\nhundred years ago, there was no under-\nstanding of sanitation, so bacterial in-\nfections were rampant. There were no\nantibiotics and no social safety nets, so\nan infectious disease was a disaster\nplunging a family into desperation.\nThomas Hobbes\u2019s characterization in\n1651 of human life as solitary, poor,\nnasty, brutish, and short was on the\nmark. Even ignoring infant mortality,\nlife expectancy was in the 30s only a\ncouple of hundred years ago. Schubert\u2019s and Mozart\u2019s deaths at\n31 and 35 respectively were typical.\n\nEckersley bases his romanticized idea of ancient life on com-\nmunication and the relationships fostered by communication.\nBut much of modern technology is directed at just this basic\nhuman need. The telephone allowed people to be together even\nif far apart geographically. The Internet is the quintessential\ncommunication technology. Social networks and the panoply of\nnew ways to make connection are creating communities based\non genuine common interests rather than the accident of\ngeography.\n\nThis decentralized electronic communication is also highly de-\nmocratizing. In a book I wrote in the mid-1980s, I predicted the\ndemise of the Soviet Union from the impact of the then-emerging\ncommunication networks, and that is indeed what happened in\nthe early 1990s. The democracy movement we saw in the 1990s\nand since is similarly fueled by our unprecedented abilities to\nstay in touch.\n\nIf Eckersley really sticks to his own philosophy, he won\u2019t be\naround for very long to in\ufb02uence the debate. But I hope that he\nwill take advantage of the life extension\u2014and enhancement\u2014\ntechnologies that will emerge in the decades ahead, so that we\ncan continue this dialogue through this century and beyond.
