[u'true names\nvernor vinge\n\nvernor vinge is one of the masters of hard science fiction who has moved to the forefront of the field\nin recent years. he is also, of all hard sf writers, the one who has been often concerned over the years\nwith computers and advances in computer technology. in contrast to william gibson, who invented an\nimage so popular and potent that it has been imposed on the real world of computers, vinge is the\nwriter who understands the technology and most accurately forecast and described in his sf the world\nof personal computer communication. "true names" is perhaps his most important story.\n\nin the once-upon\u2014a-time days of the first age of magic, the prudent sorcerer regarded his\nown true name as his most valued possession but also the greatest threat to his continued good\nhealth, for\u2014the stories go\u2014once an enemy, even a weak unskilled enemy, learned the sorcerer\'s\ntrue name, then routine and widely known spells could destroy or enslave even the most\npowerful. as times passed, and we graduated to the age of reason and thence to the first and\nsecond industrial revolutions, such notions were discredited. now it seems that the wheel has\nturned full circle (even if there never really was a first age) and we are back to worrying about\ntrue names again:\n\nthe first hint mr. slippery had that his own true name might be known and, for that\nmatter, known to the great enemy\u2014came with the appearance of two black lincolns humming up\nthe long dirt driveway that stretched through the dripping pine forest down to road 29. roger\npollack was in his garden weeding, had been there nearly the whole morning, enjoying the\nbarely perceptible drizzle and the overcast, and trying to find the initiative to go inside and do\nwork that actually makes money. he looked up the moment the intruders turned, wheels\nsquealing, into his driveway. thirty seconds passed, the cars came out of the third-generation\nforest to pull up beside and behind pollack\'s honda. four heavy-set men and a hard-looking\nfemale piled out, started purposefully across his well\u2014tended cabbage patch, crushing tender\nyoung plants with a disregard which told roger that this was no social call.\n\npollack looked wildly around, considered making a break for the woods, but the others\nhad spread out and he was grabbed and frog-marched back to his house. (fortunately the door\nhad been left unlocked. roger had the feeling that they might have knocked it down rather than\nask him for the key.) he was shoved abruptly into a chair. two of the heaviest and least\ncollegiate-looking of his visitors stood on either side of him. pollack\u2019s protests\u2014now just being\nvoiced-brought no response. the women and an older man poked around among his sets. "hey, i\nremember this, al: it\u2019s the script for 1965. see?" the woman spoke as she \ufb02ipped through the\nholo-scenes that decorated the interior wall.\n\nthe older man nodded. "i told you. he\'s written more popular games than any three men\nand even more than some agencies. roger pollack is something of a genius. "\n\nthey \'re novels, damn you, not games! old irritation \ufb02ashed unbidden into\n\nroger\'s mind. aloud. "yeah, but most of my fans aren\'t as persistent as you all."\n\n"most of your fans don\'t know that you are a criminal, mr. pollack."\n\n"criminal? i\'m no criminal-but i do know my rights. you fbi types must identify\nyourselves, give me a phone call, and\u2014"\n\nthe woman smiled for the first time. it was not a nice smile. she was about thirty\u2014five,\nhatchet-faced, her hair drawn back in the single braid favored by military types. even so it could\nhave been a nicer smile. pollack felt a chill start up his spine. "perhaps that would be true, if we\nwere the fbi or if you were not the scum you are. but this is a welfare department bust,']
